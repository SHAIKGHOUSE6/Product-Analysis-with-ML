# Product-Analysis-with-ML
🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes laptop pricing data to understand how hardware specifications influence price and to identify value-for-money segments in the laptop market. The analysis simulates real-world tasks such as price comparison, feature impact analysis, and market segmentation and to build a baseline machine learning model that predicts product price based on hardware specifications and to understand which features most influence pricing.
🎯 Objectives
Analyze how RAM, storage, processor, and brand affect laptop prices
Identify price bands (Budget / Mid-range / Premium)
Compare brands based on average price and specifications
Detect overpriced vs value-for-money configurations
Practice data cleaning and analytical thinking on real product data
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib / seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
📌 Key Analysis Performed
Price distribution across brands
Impact of RAM and storage type (SSD vs HDD) on price
Processor-wise price comparison
Price band segmentation
Average price by brand
Detection of outliers and overpriced models
Correlation analysis between specs and price
📈 Key Insights
Laptops with SSD storage are priced significantly higher than HDD-based models.
RAM upgrades show diminishing price returns beyond a certain point.
Some brands charge a premium without proportional hardware improvements.
Mid-range laptops offer the best price-to-performance ratio.
Linear Regression achieved moderate performance, indicating non-linear relationships between specs and price.
Tree-based models captured feature interactions more effectively.
RAM and SSD storage were among the strongest price predictors.
🧠 What I Learned
Cleaning inconsistent product specification data
Converting categorical specs into analyzable formats
Interpreting correlations instead of blindly trusting them
Thinking like a pricing analyst, not just a coder
Understanding of feature encoding
Train-test split and model evaluation
Awareness of overfitting vs underfitting
Ability to connect ML output to business reasoning
